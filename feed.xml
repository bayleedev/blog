This is largely based on my multi-year adventure with needs based relating, a way of empowering yourself to build connections and change the world around you. I’ve been doing some self discovery and realized I had a lot of “rules”, which I don’t think are serving me anymore and need to be updated to better fit my world view, this is the process that I created to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rules&quot;&gt;Rules&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rules are very common, I think rules and boundaries are often used interchangeably with the people I interact with. A rule might look like “Don’t yell at me” or “Don’t tell me what to do”. At the surface level, these sound very empowering. Who wants to be yelled at? If you look at why you don’t want to be yelled at, I’d suggest it’s because you sometimes feel &lt;strong&gt;scared&lt;/strong&gt; around people yelling. So with a slightly improved translation of the boundary would be “You make me feel &lt;strong&gt;scared&lt;/strong&gt; when you yell”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may have heard the idea that nobody can make you feel something without your consent. If somebody yells do you always feel scared? I’d suggest no, sometimes you might feel &lt;strong&gt;exhilarated&lt;/strong&gt; when the person next to you, on a roller coaster, starts yelling. Maybe you feel &lt;strong&gt;worried&lt;/strong&gt; when somebody down the road yells to ask out for help. Maybe you’d feel &lt;strong&gt;playful&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;stimulated&lt;/strong&gt; when you push your child on a swing and they scream out of excitement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needs based relating has a similar idea. Your feelings are just indicators to your body that your needs are met or not met. In the example of being yelled at I’m guessing you had needs for &lt;strong&gt;peace&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;ease&lt;/strong&gt;. I believe (in most cases) you can meet these needs yourself, regardless of the other person. For example, my need for peace and ease is met when I’m sitting on my balcony with Princess sipping my morning coffee. Outside of the context of the no yelling rule, how do you meet your needs for peace and ease?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;boundaries&quot;&gt;Boundaries&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d suggest the point of a boundary is to help meet your needs, not to control or manipulate others. I’ve also suggested you’re capable of meeting your own needs. So let’s convert what we know into an empowered boundary. Instead of saying “Don’t yell at me” to another person we could say “When somebody around me yells, I sometimes feel scared and it doesn’t meet my needs for &lt;strong&gt;peace&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;ease&lt;/strong&gt;. If somebody yells I will grab my coffee and go to my balcony”. The important part here is knowing what the needs are, and how YOU can meet them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;requests&quot;&gt;Requests&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people can recognize needs in themselves for &lt;strong&gt;interdependence&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;connection&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;community&lt;/strong&gt;. These needs aren’t met just by making boundaries, we also want to involve others in order to help meet these needs. For some interactions, like with strangers, these needs might not be useful to meet and rules can be applied. Keep in mind, a rule might not meet others’ needs for &lt;strong&gt;autonomy&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;connection&lt;/strong&gt;.So let’s try again to ask for others to help meet your needs. I propose the most useful way to do this is with &lt;strong&gt;openness&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;vulnerability&lt;/strong&gt; by sharing your feelings, needs, current boundaries and making a request. In NVC they make a distinction between requests and demands in that a demand the other person can’t say no. Demands start sounding very much like “rules” from before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they say no to your request, the way you’ll meet your need was made clear in your boundary. If we make the request using positive action language it might look like “Would you be willing to not yell when you’re around me?” or “Would you be willing to yell outside?”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To wrap up the process we went from “Don’t yell at me” to “When somebody around me yells, I sometimes feel scared and it doesn’t meet my needs for &lt;strong&gt;peace&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;ease&lt;/strong&gt;. If somebody yells I will grab my coffee and go to my balcony. I’d also really like to continue this conversation, would you be willing to not yell during this conversation?”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my rules was “Don’t tell me what to do” and I realized, that’s me telling others what to do! Yikes. When I rephrase my words to better meet my needs, I also open the door for their feelings and needs which enables &lt;strong&gt;connection&lt;/strong&gt;. If everything we do is to meet a need, then the other person yelling is an attempt to meet a need. If you can discover that need, you open up a realm of possibilities to connect deeper with them, and to collaboratively transform your strategies to meet both of your needs.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Baylee (they/them/theirs)</name></author><category term="philosophy" /><category term="needs-based-relating" /><summary type="html">I’m going to distinguish between the concepts: rules, boundaries and requests.
